# Manage S3 bucket with Terraform

## Terraform
Terraform is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned. Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve your infrastructure.

Apart from the simplicity of Terraform, this tool can be used with different providers making it the best choice when working with different service. It also embraces the separation of concern (modularity), which makes it easy to break down the infrastructure into small components that can be re-used and easily maintained. You can find more details on Terraform on the official website.
